(node:9348) [MONGODB DRIVER] Warning: useUnifiedTopology is a deprecated option: useUnifiedTopology has no effect since Node.js Driver version 4.0.0 and will be removed in the next major version


SOLUTION

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/testDB'; // Update with your actual DB connection string

mongoose.connect(dbURI) // âœ… No need for useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology
  .then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB successfully"))
  .catch(err => console.error("Connection failed", err));
